*** SBA-1 ***
I created a "website" for plant parents and farmers called "PLANTcentric" (Something I made up)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I did best, boss!

============= How to navigate the "PLANTcentric" SBA ==================

1. At the landing page you will see the Brand Logo and an "Enter" button. (created on canva)
2. Click the "Enter" button to enter the main page. (Has hover effect changes to a pointer)
3. On the main page you will find a gif with animated text of the PLANTcentric logo. (created on canva) 
4. Next to it are two dropdown menus that contain info about plants, tools, and supplies. (has hover but does not lead anywhere)(changes to pointer)
5. Next to that is a login/sign Up button that leads to a form page to input info to either log-in or sign-up. (also has a "requried field" message if submitted without info) *(sign up button has hover but doesnt lead anywhere)(has hover and changes to pointer)
6. Press the back botton to return to the main page.
7. There are pictures and a text box that are all responsive to the sizing of the screen or device. (One photo disappears in the mobile view)(Text box remains but overflow of text disappears in mobile view)
8. Click the "Parent Meet-up" image. (changes to pointer)
9. This image takes you to another form that has a gif, 2 headers, and places to input info about the attendees, their emails, and what seeds, plants starts, or cuttings they will bring to the meet-up. (also has "requried field" messages if submitted without info) *("I'm locked in!" button has hover but doesnt lead anywhere)
10. Press the back botton to return to the main page.
11. Underneath the "Parent Meet-up" image button is a table that lists the best plants for pet owners. (They are all responsive but cant be clicked)(arrow changes)
